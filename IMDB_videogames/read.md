## About Dataset

### The purpose of this dataset is to gain insights into the trends of game genre popularity. 
I am particularly interested in the following questions:


Which game genres are the most popular?
What are the trends in popularity for each game genre?
Can we identify any relationship between plot, genre, and popularity?
Can we use generative NLP to generate catchy game titles or plots?

* Action
